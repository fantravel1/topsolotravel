## The Street Food Mindset

Street food eating is democratic, immediate, and real. There are no reservations, no dress codes, no pretense. You stand where generations have stood, eat what locals eat, and pay what locals pay.

For the solo traveler, street food removes every barrier between you and a culture. No restaurant host asks how many in your party. No menu requires translation. You simply point, eat, and belong.

The best meals of your travels will probably cost less than $3 and be eaten standing on a sidewalk somewhere, watching the city flow around you.

**Bon appétit, solo eater.** The street is your dining room.
