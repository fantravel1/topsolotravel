## The Solo NYC Experience

### Why It Works Alone

**Counter culture**: NYC invented solo dining. Many restaurants have counter seating designed for individuals.

**Walking city**: Unlike most American cities, you don't need a car. Walk everywhere.

**Anonymous by design**: Eight million people means nobody cares that you're alone. In the best possible way.

**Entertainment**: Movies, theater, comedy, music - all perfectly normal to attend solo.

### The NYC Social Contract

New Yorkers are famously "rude" - actually, they're just busy. Ask for directions - you'll get them. Start a bar conversation - often welcomed. But don't waste anyone's time with small talk.

### Getting Around

- **Subway**: $2.90 per ride, runs 24/7
- **OMNY**: Tap your credit card, capped at $34/week
- **Walking**: Manhattan is 13 miles long, 2 miles wide - very walkable
- **Citi Bike**: Bike share everywhere
- **Ferries**: NYC Ferry to Brooklyn and more - scenic and cheap

## NYC's Gift to Solo Travelers

New York was built for the individual. The solo diner at the counter, the lone walker crossing Brooklyn Bridge at dawn, the single theater-goer in the cheap seats - they're not oddities, they're New Yorkers.

The city demands nothing but offers everything. You can be anonymous or make friends, spend nothing or spend thousands, see world-famous art or discover a neighborhood dive bar. Every choice is valid. Every path is yours.

Sinatra was right: if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. And making it alone? That's the most New York thing of all.

**Welcome to New York. It's been waiting for you.**
