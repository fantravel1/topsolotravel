quickAnswer: "A solo day in Prague starts early at Prague Castle — arrive at 9am when it opens to explore courtyards and St. Vitus Cathedral in peace. Walk down through Malá Strana's baroque streets to Charles Bridge (crowded but magical). Afternoons are for Old Town's astronomical clock and hidden courtyards. Evenings belong to beer halls (pivnice) where the half-liter costs €2, then jazz clubs in medieval cellars. Budget 900-1,500 CZK ($40-70)."

reality:
  expect: "Stunning architecture, incredible beer value, well-preserved history, excellent public transit, some tourist traps in Old Town"
  surprise: "How affordable everything is, how walkable the center is, how excellent the food scene has become, the depth of Jewish history"
  challenge: "Over-tourism at Charles Bridge midday, tourist trap restaurants near Old Town Square, taxis that overcharge (use apps)"

morning:
  timeRange: "8:00 AM - 12:00 PM"
  insight: "Prague Castle opens at 9am, and the first hour is magical — just you and the cathedral, no tour groups. The walk down through Malá Strana to the river is Prague at its most charming: winding streets, embassy gardens, perfect views."
  moments:
    - time: "8:30 AM"
      emoji: "☕"
      title: "Coffee with a View"
      description: "Start with coffee at Café Savoy or any Malá Strana café. The neighborhood beneath the castle is quieter than Old Town, with 17th-century buildings and embassy gardens. Fortify yourself — there's climbing ahead."
      tip: "Café Savoy's breakfast is excellent if you want more than coffee."
      cost: "80-150 CZK (€3-6)"
    - time: "9:00 AM"
      emoji: "🏰"
      title: "Prague Castle First Entry"
      description: "Walk up to the castle (or take tram 22) for opening. The courtyards are free; tickets get you inside St. Vitus Cathedral, Old Royal Palace, and Golden Lane. The cathedral's stained glass in morning light is transcendent. Early means empty."
      tip: "Buy tickets online. Circuit B (cathedral, palace, Golden Lane) is enough for most."
      cost: "250 CZK (€10)"
    - time: "10:30 AM"
      emoji: "🚶"
      title: "Descend Through Malá Strana"
      description: "Walk down the castle steps into Malá Strana, Prague's best-preserved baroque district. Wander Nerudova street (the main descent), pop into hidden gardens, find the Lennon Wall. No map needed — the river is your compass."
      tip: "Vrtba Garden is a hidden baroque gem with city views. Small entry fee, big reward."
      cost: "Free (or 65 CZK for Vrtba Garden)"
    - time: "11:30 AM"
      emoji: "🌉"
      title: "Charles Bridge Crossing"
      description: "Yes, it's crowded. Go anyway. The 30 baroque statues, the castle behind you, the Old Town towers ahead — there's a reason it's famous. Walk slowly, stop at the statue of St. John of Nepomuk (touch the brass plaques for luck), and cross into Old Town."
      tip: "Early morning (6-7am) and evening (sunset) are less crowded and more beautiful."
      cost: "Free"

      title: "First Beer (It's Noon Somewhere)"
      description: "Czech beer is a food group. Find a pivnice (beer hall) away from Old Town Square. Order a 'pivo' (beer) — Pilsner Urquell, Staropramen, or whatever's on tap. A half-liter costs 40-60 CZK (€2). Yes, really. Pair with utopenec (pickled sausage)."
      tip: "Lokál is a chain with excellent tank beer. U Zlatého Tygra is a legendary dive."

      emoji: "🕰️"
      title: "Old Town Wandering"
      description: "Old Town Square has the famous astronomical clock (see it on the hour for the apostle procession). But the real magic is in the side streets — hidden courtyards, gothic churches, art nouveau details. Get deliberately lost. It's impossible to stay lost."
      tip: "The Jewish Quarter (Josefov) is nearby and essential — synagogues and the oldest Jewish cemetery in Europe."
      cost: "Free (Jewish Quarter 500 CZK/€20)"
    - time: "4:00 PM"
      emoji: "🥟"
      title: "Trdelník Break"
      description: "The spiral chimney cake (trdelník) is everywhere — technically Hungarian, now claimed by Prague. Get one fresh, maybe filled with ice cream or Nutella. Eat it walking along the river. Peak tourist behavior, but delicious."
      tip: "The stands near Charles Bridge are tourist traps. Look for local bakeries."
      cost: "100 CZK (€4)"
    - time: "5:30 PM"
      emoji: "📚"
      title: "Kafka Walk"
      description: "Franz Kafka was born here, wrote here, and is buried here. Walk past his birthplace (near Old Town Square), visit the rotating head sculpture in Dušní street, or find his grave in the New Jewish Cemetery. For literature lovers, it's pilgrimage."
      tip: "The Kafka Museum in Malá Strana is excellent, if niche."
      cost: "Free-200 CZK (€8)"

      title: "Czech Dinner"
      description: "Czech food is hearty: svíčková (beef in cream sauce), vepřo-knedlo-zelo (pork, dumplings, sauerkraut), or guláš. Beer halls serve portions for hungry people. Sit at the long tables, order through the waiter who appears, and consume. More beer will arrive unbidden."
      tip: "U Fleků is touristy but historic (brewing since 1499). Lokál for authentic."

    - time: "9:00 PM"
      emoji: "🎷"
      title: "Jazz Club Evening"
      description: "Prague has an incredible jazz scene, often in medieval cellars. Jazz Dock floats on the river with water views. AghaRTA has nightly shows in a brick cellar. Solo seats at the bar are easy to get, and the music fills any silence."
      tip: "Check schedules online. Cover is usually 200-400 CZK."

      emoji: "🌉"
      title: "Night Bridge Crossing"
      description: "Return to Charles Bridge after the crowds disperse. The castle lit on the hill, the river dark below, the baroque saints watching from their pedestals — this is Prague at its most magical. Walk slowly. The city rewards night wanderers."
      cost: "Free"

night:
  timeRange: "11:00 PM onwards"
  moments:
    - time: "Late"
      emoji: "🍻"
      title: "Late Night Options"
      description: "Prague's nightlife runs late. Beer halls close around midnight, bars later. Clubs (in Dlouhá street and Holešovice) go until dawn. Or simply walk — the city is safe, beautiful, and surprisingly empty after midnight."
      tip: "Cross Manifesto Market (open late) for food and drinks in a cool space."
      cost: "Variable"

proTip: "Buy a 24-hour transit pass (120 CZK) for unlimited trams, buses, and metro. Trams are the best way to cover distance while seeing the city — especially tram 22 through the castle district."

moment:
  quote: "At U Zlatého Tygra, a legendary pub that serves only Pilsner, I found the last empty seat at a table of Czech men who'd been coming there for decades. We couldn't speak each other's languages, but we toasted to everything — to beer, to Prague, to the absurdity of life. They taught me to say 'na zdraví' properly. I belong in this city now."
  location: "U Zlatého Tygra, Old Town"
  time: "8:45 PM"

faqs:
  - question: "Is Prague good for solo travelers?"
    answer: "Prague is excellent for solo travelers. The city is compact, safe, and extremely affordable. Beer hall culture means sitting at communal tables is normal — you'll share space with locals naturally. The prices (especially for beer) make extended solo stays very possible."
  - question: "How much does a day in Prague cost?"
    answer: "Prague is remarkably affordable: a comfortable day costs 900-1,500 CZK ($40-70). Coffee (80 CZK), castle (250 CZK), beer (50 CZK each, have several), lunch (150 CZK), dinner (400 CZK), jazz club (350 CZK). You can spend much less."
  - question: "Is Prague safe at night?"
    answer: "Very safe. The center is well-populated until late, and violent crime is rare. Watch for pickpockets in tourist areas and avoid unlicensed taxis (use Bolt or Uber apps instead). Walking alone at night through Old Town is perfectly normal."
  - question: "Should I avoid tourist traps?"
    answer: "Yes — Old Town Square restaurants with picture menus overcharge for mediocre food. Walk five minutes in any direction for better food at half the price. Authentic pivnice (beer halls) are cheaper and better than anything on the square."

## Your Day in Prague Awaits

Prague survived Nazis and communism with its beauty intact. The spires still pierce the sky as they did in the Middle Ages. The beer still costs almost nothing. The fairy tale is real.

Solo travelers have been wandering these cobblestones for centuries — Kafka, Rilke, countless others seeking something in these winding streets. Today you join them.

The castle is waiting. The beer is cold. Prague doesn't disappoint.
