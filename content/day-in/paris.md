quickAnswer: "A solo day in Paris begins at a zinc-counter café around 8am with a café crème and croissant — the most Parisian possible start. Mornings are for wandering: the Marais, Saint-Germain, or Montmartre before crowds arrive. Afternoons belong to museums (book Musée d'Orsay or Orangerie) or simply sitting in the Tuileries. Evenings bring wine bars with natural wines and cheese plates, then a moonlit walk along the Seine. Budget €75-110 for a full day including meals, one museum, and wine."

    description: "That specific Parisian melancholy that's actually contentment"

reality:
  expect: "Beautiful architecture everywhere, excellent public transit, world-class food at all price points, a culture that respects solitude"
  surprise: "How small the central city is (walkable!), how affordable wine and cheese can be, how Parisians actually warm up if you try French, the joy of sitting alone at cafés"
  challenge: "Service can feel cold (it's just French), Sundays many places close, the major attractions require advance booking, finding affordable accommodation"

morning:
  timeRange: "8:00 AM - 12:00 PM"
  insight: "Parisians have perfected the art of the solo morning. Café counters welcome individuals — standing with your espresso is actually the local way. The city is gentler before noon: bakeries are fresh, gardens are quiet, and the light through Haussmann windows is golden."

      title: "Café Counter Ritual"
      description: "Find a corner café with a zinc counter. Order 'un café crème' and a croissant at the bar (cheaper than seated). Watch Paris wake up through the window. The barman will ignore you beautifully — this is respect, not rudeness. You belong here."
      tip: "Counter service (au comptoir) is 30-40% cheaper than table service (en salle)."

      title: "Boulangerie Hunt"
      description: "Every neighborhood has its champion bakery. Look for 'Artisan Boulanger' signs and queues of locals. Buy a pain au chocolat still warm. Eat it walking, as Parisians do. The flakes on your jacket are a badge of honor."
      tip: "Ask for 'bien cuit' if you like it crispy. Most tourists get pale croissants."

      title: "The Marais Wander"
      description: "The Marais is Paris at its most walkable. Medieval streets, hidden courtyards (push open heavy doors marked 'cour'), Jewish delis, concept stores, and café terraces. No agenda required — just follow what looks interesting."
      tip: "Place des Vosges is Paris's oldest square. Sit under the arcades and read."

      tip: "The upstairs is quieter. There's a piano anyone can play."

      title: "Garden Sitting"
      description: "Parisians treat parks as outdoor living rooms. Grab a green metal chair in the Tuileries or Luxembourg Gardens, face it toward the sun, and do nothing. Watch children sail boats, lovers argue, old men play chess. This is participation."

      tip: "Le Comptoir du Panthéon, Chez Janou, or any place with 'Chez' in the name."

      tip: "Belleville and Oberkampf stay lively latest. Saint-Germain gets quiet early."

proTip: "Buy a carnet of 10 Metro tickets (cheaper per ride) or get the Navigo Easy card and load tickets onto it. The Metro goes everywhere, runs frequently, and is completely safe."

moment:
  quote: "At the wine bar, the man next to me asked what I was reading. We talked for an hour about books, then he left with a 'bonne continuation' — good continuation, the perfect French farewell. He didn't ask for my number or suggest we meet again. It was complete in itself. That's Paris."
  location: "Cave à vin in the 11th"
  time: "8:30 PM, a Wednesday"

faqs:
  - question: "Is Paris good for solo travelers?"
    answer: "Paris is exceptional for solo travelers. The café culture celebrates sitting alone — no one will rush you or pity you. Museums are designed for individual contemplation. Walking is the best way to explore, and you can walk alone for hours in beauty. The city has romanticized solitude for centuries."
  - question: "How much does a day in Paris cost?"
    answer: "A comfortable solo day in Paris costs €75-110 ($80-120). This includes coffee and pastry (€8), lunch (€15), one museum (€15), wine bar and snacks (€25), dinner (€35-50), and Metro rides (€8). You can go much cheaper with picnics from markets and free walks."
  - question: "Is it safe to walk alone in Paris at night?"
    answer: "Central Paris is generally very safe at night. The main tourist areas, the Marais, Saint-Germain, and along the Seine are well-lit and populated. Normal city awareness applies: avoid empty parks after dark, watch your belongings on the Metro, and be aware of occasional pickpockets in touristy spots."
  - question: "Where should solo travelers stay in Paris?"
    answer: "The Marais (3rd/4th) is central, vibrant, and walkable. Saint-Germain (6th) is classic and café-rich. For something local, try the 11th (Oberkampf area) or 10th (Canal Saint-Martin) — younger, more diverse, excellent food. All are well-connected by Metro."

## Your Day in Paris Awaits

Paris has never required company to be magical.

The café counter, the garden chair facing the sun, the museum bench in front of a painting that stops your breath — these moments are singular by design. The French have a word, flâneur, for one who wanders the city with no purpose but attention. Today, you're a flâneur.

The city will meet you where you are. It asks only that you show up, sit down, and let the hours unfold.
