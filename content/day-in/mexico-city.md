quickAnswer: "A solo day in CDMX starts with chilaquiles at a market stall or café — the perfect breakfast exists here. Mornings are for neighborhoods: Roma and Condesa's tree-lined streets, or the historic centro's baroque churches and murals. Afternoons belong to museums (Frida's Blue House is essential, book ahead). Evenings bring mezcal bars, taco stands that peak at 10pm, and the realization that Mexico City might be the world's best food city. Budget 700-1,200 MXN ($35-60)."

reality:
  expect: "Incredible food at all prices, world-class museums, distinct neighborhoods, friendly locals, some traffic chaos"
  surprise: "How safe the main neighborhoods feel, how cheap excellent food is, how much there is beyond the centro, the depth of pre-Hispanic history"
  challenge: "Air quality some days, altitude adjustment (7,400 ft), navigating without Spanish, traffic makes crossing town slow"

morning:
  timeRange: "9:00 AM - 12:00 PM"
  insight: "CDMX mornings are leisurely. Markets open early but restaurants follow Mexican time. The best strategy: wander, graze, caffeinate. Roma and Condesa have European café vibes; the centro has raw energy. Both work."

      title: "Chilaquiles Breakfast"
      description: "Find a café or market stall serving chilaquiles — tortilla chips in salsa (red or green), topped with cream, cheese, and optional egg or chicken. This is the Mexican breakfast. Order café de olla (spiced coffee) alongside. You're ready for anything."
      tip: "El Cardenal for upscale, any market stall for authentic. 'Verdes' (green) is tangy, 'rojos' (red) is smokier."

      description: "These adjacent neighborhoods have tree-lined streets, art deco buildings, excellent coffee, and the city's best restaurants. Walk Avenida Amsterdam (circular, following an old racetrack), pop into boutiques, find a bench in Parque México. Solo strollers fit perfectly."
      tip: "Look up — the architecture is the attraction. Many buildings survived the 1985 earthquake; some didn't."

      title: "Third-Wave Coffee"
      description: "CDMX's coffee scene is excellent — Chiapas beans, skilled baristas, gorgeous spaces. Chiquitito, Almanegra, Blend Station — pick one, sit with your book, watch the neighborhood. WiFi is everywhere; digital nomads are too."
      tip: "Mexican coffee is often lighter roast than expected. Ask for 'fuerte' if you want stronger."

      title: "Taco Lunch"
      description: "Tacos are a way of life here. Find a busy stand (crowds = quality), order 3-4 different options, apply salsa liberally, repeat. Al pastor (spit-roasted pork), suadero (brisket), and carnitas (braised pork) are essentials. Standing at the counter is correct form."

      title: "Mezcal Tasting"
      description: "Mezcal is tequila's complex cousin, and CDMX has bars dedicated to it. Sit at the bar at La Clandestina or Bósforo, tell them what you like, and let them guide you through flights. The bartenders are educators. Solo drinkers learn most."
      tip: "Start with espadín (common), graduate to tobalá or madrecuixe. Sip, don't shoot."

      title: "Night Tacos"
      description: "The best tacos happen after dark. Taco stands fire up around 8pm and peak at midnight. Find a street corner with smoke, crowds, and fast-moving taqueros. Order, eat standing, order more. This is when CDMX truly feeds itself."
      tip: "Tacos El Califa de León in Roma won a Michelin star. Street tacos deserve the same respect."

      title: "Roma Night Walk"
      description: "Roma and Condesa stay lively late. Bars spill onto sidewalks, restaurants seat until midnight, and the streets feel safe and social. Walk without destination, stop where the vibe is right. CDMX rewards night wanderers."
      tip: "Pulquería Las Duelistas for pulque (fermented agave, ancient drink). Acquired taste but worth trying."
      cost: "Variable"

      emoji: "💃"
      title: "Late Night Options"
      description: "Roma and Condesa bars stay open late. Clubs in Polanco and Juárez go until dawn. Or find a late-night taco spot (many run until 3-4am) and refuel. CDMX's energy doesn't fade — it just shifts neighborhoods."
      tip: "Uber is reliable and cheap for late-night transport. Metro closes at midnight."

proTip: "Get a metro card for cheap transit (5 MXN per ride), but Uber is so affordable that door-to-door often makes sense. The city is huge — don't underestimate distances. Roma to Coyoacán is 45+ minutes."

moment:
  quote: "At the taco stand at 11pm, I was the only foreigner among office workers, couples, and taxi drivers all eating the same perfect al pastor. The taquero saw me hesitate at the salsa bar and said 'esta, no pica' — this one doesn't burn. Small kindness. Perfect meal."
  location: "Taquería in Roma Norte"
  time: "11:15 PM"

faqs:
  - question: "Is Mexico City safe for solo travelers?"
    answer: "In the main neighborhoods (Roma, Condesa, Coyoacán, Polanco, Centro), CDMX is quite safe. Normal urban awareness applies. Avoid empty streets late at night, use Uber instead of street taxis, and don't flash expensive items. Millions of solo travelers visit safely every year."
  - question: "How much does a day in Mexico City cost?"
    answer: "CDMX is remarkably affordable. A comfortable day costs 700-1,200 MXN ($35-60): breakfast (140), coffee (80), taco lunch (120), museum (270), mezcal (250), night tacos (150), transit (150). Budget travelers can do €25; splurging on nice restaurants still rarely exceeds €80."
  - question: "Do I need to speak Spanish?"
    answer: "Basic Spanish helps enormously. In Roma/Condesa/Polanco, English is common. In markets, traditional neighborhoods, and street food spots, it's less so. Learn food words, numbers, and pleasantries. Locals appreciate any effort."
  - question: "What about the altitude?"
    answer: "Mexico City is at 7,400 feet (2,240m). You may feel breathless climbing stairs, get tired faster, or have mild headaches the first day or two. Hydrate, go easy on alcohol, and don't plan anything strenuous on day one."

## Your Day in CDMX Awaits

Mexico City is overwhelming in the best way — a megalopolis of 21 million people that somehow feels like a collection of villages. Each neighborhood has its own rhythm, its own tacos, its own reason to exist.

Solo travelers find something particular here: a food culture that feeds individuals beautifully, a hospitality that extends to strangers, and a creative energy that makes every day feel like discovery.

The tacos are waiting. The mezcal is poured. Mexico City doesn't do things small, but it does them well.
