quickAnswer: "A solo day in Chiang Mai begins early with temple visits — Wat Phra Singh and Wat Chedi Luang are within the old city walls, both free and peaceful before 9am. Book a cooking class (essential — you'll learn 5 dishes, eat them all, and meet fellow travelers). Afternoons are for cafés and wandering. Evenings mean night markets (Sunday Walking Street is legendary) and rooftop bars with mountain views. Budget 800-1,500 THB ($25-45)."

    description: "Slow Northern Thai pace, everyone's welcome here"

reality:
  expect: "Incredible food, ancient temples, digital nomad infrastructure, friendly locals, mountains nearby"
  surprise: "How cheap everything is, how easy solo travel is here, the quality of the coffee scene, how much there is outside the old city"
  challenge: "April burning season (smoky), tourist traps around the old city, motorbike traffic takes adjustment"

morning:
  timeRange: "7:00 AM - 12:00 PM"
  insight: "Northern Thai mornings are peaceful. Monks collect alms at dawn, temples are empty before tour groups arrive, and the air is cooler. The old city (inside the moat) is small enough to walk, and temple-hopping is free meditation."

      title: "Coffee Culture"
      description: "Chiang Mai's coffee scene rivals any city's. Ristr8to is world-champion level. Graph is perfectly third-wave. Find your spot, order an iced coffee (it's hot already), and ease into the day. Wi-fi is everywhere — this is digital nomad central."
      tip: "Ristr8to's signature latte art is worth the wait. Cash often preferred."

      title: "Temple Circuit"
      description: "The old city has 30+ temples in walking distance. Wat Phra Singh (gold Buddha, ancient murals) and Wat Chedi Luang (ruined tower, spiritual atmosphere) are essential. Remove shoes, dress modestly, light incense. Solo temple visits feel like personal pilgrimage."

      title: "Cooking Class"
      description: "Book a half-day class (morning or afternoon). You'll visit a market, pick ingredients, then cook 4-5 dishes in a garden kitchen: tom yum, curry, pad thai, mango sticky rice. You eat everything you make. Solo travelers mix with couples and groups — everyone learns together."
      tip: "Asia Scenic, Thai Farm, Pantawan — all excellent. Book ahead."

      description: "Chiang Mai's night markets are legendary. Sunday Walking Street fills the entire old city with food and crafts. Saturday is Wua Lai street. Nightly: Chang Phuak for grilled chicken, the Night Bazaar for everything. Solo travelers graze stall to stall — the only way to do it."
      tip: "Sunday is unmissable but packed. Arrive early (5pm) for easier movement."

      description: "After a day of walking, let someone fix you. Thai massage is an institution — firm, stretchy, sometimes painful, always reviving. Walk-in shops everywhere, 200-300 THB for an hour. Solo travelers getting massaged in a room of strangers is completely normal."

proTip: "Rent a motorbike (200-300 THB/day) if you're comfortable riding — the city opens up completely. If not, songthaews (red trucks) go everywhere for 20-30 THB. Grab/Bolt apps work too."

moment:
  quote: "In the cooking class, I was the only solo person among couples. By dish three, the couples had broken into groups by country, and I'd somehow adopted a Dutch grandmother who wanted to learn my pad thai technique. By the end, she'd invited me to Amsterdam. Solo travel, but never alone."

  time: "11:30 AM"

faqs:
  - question: "Is Chiang Mai good for solo travelers?"
    answer: "Chiang Mai might be the world's easiest solo travel destination. The digital nomad community means cafés are full of people working alone. Cooking classes mix solo travelers. Street food is designed for individual grazing. The locals are warm, English is widespread, and everything is affordable."
  - question: "How much does a day in Chiang Mai cost?"
    answer: "A comfortable day costs 800-1,500 THB ($25-45). Coffee (100 THB), temples (free), khao soi (60 THB), cooking class (1,200 THB — optional but recommended), night market dinner (300 THB), massage (250 THB), drinks (300 THB). Without the cooking class, days can be €20 total."
  - question: "Is Chiang Mai safe for solo women?"
    answer: "Very safe. Thailand generally, and Chiang Mai specifically, has an excellent reputation for solo female travelers. Normal awareness applies, but violent crime is rare, and the tourist infrastructure is very developed. Many solo female travelers stay for weeks or months."
  - question: "How long should I stay?"
    answer: "Minimum 3-4 days to see temples, do a cooking class, and explore properly. Many solo travelers stay weeks — the monthly cost of living (housing, food, coworking) is around $800-1,200, attracting digital nomads for extended stays."

## Your Day in Chiang Mai Awaits

Chiang Mai is the slow exhale after Bangkok's intensity. Temples instead of malls. Mountains instead of skyscrapers. A pace that says 'stay a while.'

Solo travelers have been finding themselves here for decades — first backpackers, then yogis, now digital nomads. The infrastructure for independence is unmatched: cheap food, endless cafés, cooking classes designed to mix strangers, massages that fix whatever the day broke.

The temples have been waiting 600 years. They can wait for you to finish your khao soi.
