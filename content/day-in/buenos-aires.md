quickAnswer: "A solo day in Buenos Aires starts late — this is a city that dines at 10pm and dances until dawn. Morning means café con leche and medialunas at a historic confitería. Afternoons bring neighborhood wandering: San Telmo's antiques and street tango, Recoleta's European grandeur, Palermo's parks and boutiques. Evenings are for steak (parilla) and wine, then milongas where strangers become dance partners. Budget 15,000-25,000 ARS ($40-70)."

morning:
  timeRange: "10:00 AM - 1:00 PM"
  insight: "Buenos Aires doesn't do early mornings. Breakfast means medialunas (croissants) and café con leche at confiterías that have served writers and revolutionaries for a century. The newspaper-reading, people-watching morning café is a porteño institution."

      title: "Confitería Breakfast"
      description: "Find a classic confitería — Café Tortoni is the most famous, but any place with marble tables and bow-tied waiters will do. Order café con leche and medialunas (the small croissants, slightly sweet). Read, write, watch. This is how Buenos Aires starts."
      tip: "Tortoni has queues. Try Las Violetas in Almagro or El Federal in San Telmo for similar vibes, fewer tourists."

proTip: "Bring US dollars and exchange at 'cuevas' (informal exchange houses) for the blue dollar rate — often 30-50% better than official. Ask your hostel or hotel for recommendations. This is normal and expected."

moment:
  quote: "At the milonga, an older woman caught my eye from across the room — the cabeceo. I nodded, she nodded, and suddenly I was dancing tango with a stranger in Buenos Aires at 2am. She didn't speak English; I didn't speak Spanish. We danced three songs without a word. No words needed."
  location: "La Viruta, Palermo"
  time: "2:15 AM"

faqs:
  - question: "Is Buenos Aires good for solo travelers?"
    answer: "Excellent. The café culture welcomes solo sitters, parillas seat solo diners warmly, and tango culture is built around strangers connecting. The city runs late, which suits self-directed travelers. English is common in tourist areas."
  - question: "How much does a day in Buenos Aires cost?"
    answer: "Argentina's economic fluctuations make this variable, but at blue dollar rates, Buenos Aires is affordable: 15,000-25,000 ARS ($40-70) covers breakfast, lunch, a tango class, excellent steak dinner with wine, and milonga entry. Even upscale restaurants feel reasonable."
  - question: "What's the blue dollar?"
    answer: "Argentina has official and unofficial exchange rates. The 'blue dollar' (informal) gives significantly more pesos per dollar than banks/ATMs. Ask your accommodation about exchange — this is normal and legal for tourists. Bring cash dollars; they're widely preferred."
  - question: "Is it safe at night?"
    answer: "Recoleta, Palermo, San Telmo, and Centro are generally safe late. Avoid flashy displays of wealth, use registered taxis or Uber, and be aware of your surroundings. The city lives at night — you won't be alone on the streets."

## Your Day in Buenos Aires Awaits

Buenos Aires doesn't start until everyone else is tired. Dinner at 10pm, dancing at midnight, the city's best conversations at 3am.

This is a city of grand gestures and beautiful sadness — the tango was born from immigrant longing, and that melancholy still perfumes the air. But it's also vibrant, warm, and welcoming to strangers who show up alone and open.

The parilla is hot. The Malbec is open. Buenos Aires doesn't judge — it embraces.
