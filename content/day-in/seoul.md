quickAnswer: "A solo day in Seoul starts at Gyeongbokgung Palace — rent a hanbok (free entry if you wear one!) and feel like royalty among the gates and pavilions. Mornings in the traditional Bukchon neighborhood feel centuries away from the afternoon's neon: K-beauty shopping in Myeongdong, street food everywhere, and the realization that Seoul feeds solo diners better than almost anywhere. Evenings bring Korean BBQ (yes, solo!) and noraebang (private singing rooms). Budget 70,000-110,000 KRW ($50-80)."

morning:
  timeRange: "9:00 AM - 12:00 PM"
  insight: "Seoul mornings balance old and new perfectly. The palaces open at 9am — rent a hanbok for free entry and spectacular photos. Traditional tea houses wake slowly. The subway is world-class. And even the ancient spaces have WiFi."

      title: "Hanbok and Palace"
      description: "Rent a hanbok (traditional Korean dress) near Gyeongbokgung — shops are everywhere. In hanbok, palace entry is free, and you'll feel part of the scene rather than observing it. Walk the vast courtyards, pose at Gyeonghoeru pavilion, become your own historical drama."
      tip: "Hanbok rental: 15,000-25,000 KRW for 2-4 hours. Go early before crowds."

      title: "Bukchon Hanok Village"
      description: "Walk from the palace to Bukchon, where 600-year-old hanok houses climb the hillside. The alleys are photogenic, the views to Namsan Tower stunning, and traditional tea houses offer rest. Go slow — these are actual homes, not a museum."
      tip: "Follow the '8 scenic spots' trail. Keep quiet — residents live here."
      cost: "Free"
    - time: "11:30 AM"
      emoji: "☕"
      title: "Korean Tea House"
      description: "Find a traditional tea house (try Suyeon Sanbang or Cha Masineun Tteul) for omija-cha (five-flavor tea) or yuja-cha (citron tea). Sit on floor cushions, look at a courtyard garden, and feel time slow down. Solo tea drinking is deeply Korean."
      tip: "Rice cakes often accompany tea. Try them."

      description: "Korea's oldest market is street food heaven. Find a pojangmacha (tent bar) stall, sit at the counter, and point at what looks good: bindaetteok (mung bean pancakes), japchae, tteokbokki, kimbap. The ajummas (market ladies) will feed you royally."
      tip: "Mayak kimbap ('drug kimbap' — it's addictive) and knife-cut noodles are signatures."

      description: "Take the cable car or walk up to N Seoul Tower for sunset city views. The love locks are cheesy but somehow still romantic. The view of Seoul — endless city to every horizon — is humbling. Solo travelers lean on the railing and contemplate scale."
      tip: "Cable car: 12,000 KRW round trip. Tower observation: 16,000 KRW. Combined ticket saves."

      title: "Korean BBQ for One"
      description: "Yes, you can do Korean BBQ solo. Some restaurants have single-serving portions (baekban); others seat solo diners at shared grills. Or try samgyeopsal (pork belly) at a counter spot. The grill, the banchan, the lettuce wraps — it all works alone."
      tip: "Baekjeong in Majang Meat Market serves singles. Or try jjigae (stew) if BBQ feels awkward."

      description: "Chimaek (chicken + maekju/beer) is the Korean national late-night activity. Fried chicken here is art — double-fried, crispy, often glazed. Find a chain (Kyochon, BBQ) or local spot, order a half chicken and a beer. Solo chimaek is extremely normal."
      tip: "Delivery is huge in Seoul. Order to your hotel via Coupang Eats if you need solitude."

      description: "Private karaoke rooms (noraebang) are designed for any group size — including one. Get a small room for an hour, flip through the English songs, and sing your heart out. No audience, no judgment, pure catharsis. This is why Koreans stay sane."
      tip: "'Coin noraebang' machines charge per song and are even more solo-friendly."
      cost: "5,000-15,000 KRW (€3-10)"

      description: "Seoul doesn't sleep. Hongdae has clubs until dawn. Itaewon has international bars. Jjimjilbang (Korean spas) are open 24 hours — pay €10 to soak, steam, and sleep on heated floors if you miss the last subway. The convenience of 24-hour Korea is remarkable."
      tip: "Last subway: around midnight. First subway: 5:30am. The gap is what jjimjilbangs are for."

proTip: "Get a T-money card at any convenience store — it works on all subways, buses, and even taxis. The Seoul subway is among the world's best: clean, on time, signs in English, and WiFi in every car."

moment:
  quote: "In the noraebang at midnight, alone in a tiny room with a disco ball, I sang every power ballad I knew at full volume. When 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' came on, I gave the performance of my life to an audience of zero. Sometimes solo travel is about finding spaces to be completely yourself."
  location: "Hongdae Noraebang"
  time: "12:30 AM"

faqs:
  - question: "Is Seoul good for solo travelers?"
    answer: "Extremely. Despite the language barrier, Seoul's infrastructure is so good that navigation is effortless. The food culture accommodates solo diners beautifully — from street food to sit-down meals. Safety is exceptional. And activities like noraebang and jjimjilbang are designed for individuals."
  - question: "How much does a day in Seoul cost?"
    answer: "A comfortable day costs 70,000-110,000 KRW ($50-80). Palace/hanbok (20,000), tea (10,000), lunch (15,000), tower (25,000), BBQ (25,000), chimaek (20,000), noraebang (10,000), transit (5,000). Budget travelers can cut significantly with street food and free activities."
  - question: "Is the language barrier a problem?"
    answer: "Less than you'd expect. Major tourist areas have English signage, subway is fully bilingual, and apps like Papago translate menus and conversations. Younger Koreans often speak English. The barrier exists but rarely blocks solo travelers."
  - question: "Where should solo travelers stay?"
    answer: "Hongdae for nightlife and youth energy, Myeongdong for shopping convenience, Insadong for traditional vibes near palaces, Itaewon for international food and bars. All are well-connected by subway. Hostels in Hongdae are particularly social."

## Your Day in Seoul Awaits

Seoul is a city of contrasts held together by remarkable efficiency. A 600-year-old palace and a K-pop billboard share the same view. A traditional tea house has better WiFi than most Western hotels. The future arrived here early, but it didn't bulldoze the past.

Solo travelers fit seamlessly into Seoul's rhythm. The pojangmacha stall, the noraebang room, the jjimjilbang floor — all designed for individuals as much as groups. Korea understands that alone doesn't mean lonely.

Put on the hanbok. Cross the palace gates. Seoul has been waiting.
