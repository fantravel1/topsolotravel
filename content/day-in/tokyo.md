quickAnswer: "A solo day in Tokyo starts peacefully at Senso-ji Temple around 7am when crowds are thin and incense fills the air. By midday, you're swept into Shibuya's famous crossing, grabbing lunch at a depachika (basement food hall). Evenings are perfect for solo dining at izakayas with counter seating, where chefs become your hosts. Budget $60-100 for a full day including food, transport, and one activity."

morning:
  timeRange: "6:30 AM - 12:00 PM"
  insight: "Tokyoites believe morning hours are sacred. Temples are nearly empty before 8am, and the best sushi is actually at dawn at Tsukiji outer market. The 'morning set' (モーニング) at any kissaten coffee shop is a cultural experience itself."

moment:
  quote: "Sitting at the izakaya counter at 9pm, the chef placed a small dish in front of me that I hadn't ordered. 'Service,' he said with a nod. It was the most delicious pickled vegetables I'd ever tasted. In that moment, eating alone felt like a privilege, not a compromise."

faqs:
  - question: "Is Tokyo good for solo travelers?"
    answer: "Tokyo is exceptional for solo travelers. The culture embraces individual dining (many restaurants have counter seating designed for one), public transit is world-class, and the city is extremely safe at any hour. Many activities — temples, museums, walks — are better experienced alone and at your own pace."
  - question: "How much does a day in Tokyo cost?"
    answer: "A comfortable solo day in Tokyo costs ¥8,000-12,000 ($55-80). This includes transit (¥1,500), several meals at local spots (¥4,000-6,000), one activity or entrance fee (¥1,000-2,000), and incidentals. You can go cheaper with konbini meals or splurge on high-end sushi."
  - question: "Is it weird to eat alone in Tokyo?"
    answer: "Not at all — solo dining is completely normalized in Japan. Many restaurants specifically cater to individual diners with counter seating, private booths (like Ichiran ramen), and single-portion menus. Locals regularly eat alone, making it perhaps the world's best city for solo food exploration."
  - question: "What's the best neighborhood for solo travelers in Tokyo?"
    answer: "Shibuya and Shinjuku offer endless entertainment and food options. Asakusa provides traditional charm and is walkable. For a local feel, try Shimokitazawa (vintage shops, cafes) or Yanaka (old Tokyo vibes). Hostels in any of these areas make meeting other travelers easy."

## Your Day in Tokyo Awaits

This isn't a tourist checklist — it's what a real day feels like when you let Tokyo unfold around you.

The city rewards early risers with empty temples and late-night wanderers with 2am ramen. It welcomes solo diners at counters where chefs become your hosts. It challenges you with seemingly infinite train lines, then rewards you with the freedom to go anywhere for ¥200.

Tokyo doesn't care if you're alone. In fact, it's designed for it.
