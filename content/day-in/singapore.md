quickAnswer: "A solo day in Singapore starts at a hawker center — the open-air food courts that won Michelin stars and UNESCO recognition. Order kaya toast, soft-boiled eggs, and kopi for breakfast. Mornings are for the free Botanic Gardens or walking cultural neighborhoods (Chinatown, Little India, Kampong Glam). Evenings explode at Marina Bay: the Supertrees light up, water shows dance, and rooftop bars offer skyline views. Budget S$65-120 ($50-90) — expensive for Asia, but food is cheap everywhere."

morning:
  timeRange: "8:00 AM - 12:00 PM"
  insight: "Singaporeans eat out for nearly every meal — hawker centers are their kitchens. Solo diners are the majority at 8am, grabbing breakfast before work. The food is world-class, the prices are tiny, and eating alone is expected, not awkward."

proTip: "Get an EZ-Link card for public transit — it works on MRT, buses, and some taxis. The system is flawless. Alternatively, contactless credit cards work directly on MRT gates."

moment:
  quote: "At Newton Circus at 11pm, I asked a local what to order. He walked me to three different stalls, explained each dish, then sat with me while I ate. 'Visitors should eat well,' he said. He didn't want anything — just wanted to share his city's food. That's Singapore."

  time: "11:30 PM"

faqs:
  - question: "Is Singapore good for solo travelers?"
    answer: "Possibly the world's best first solo trip to Asia. It's ultra-safe (ranked #1 globally), English is official, the infrastructure is flawless, and hawker culture is built around solo eating. The heat is the only challenge. Everything else is effortless."
  - question: "How much does a day in Singapore cost?"
    answer: "Singapore is expensive for Asia but manageable: S$65-120 ($50-90) covers hawker meals (S$30), attractions (S$32), transit (S$10), and drinks (S$30). Hawker food keeps costs down; accommodation and alcohol drive them up."
  - question: "Is the food really that good?"
    answer: "Yes. Singapore has two Michelin-starred hawker stalls. Anthony Bourdain called it the world's greatest food city. The combination of Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Peranakan cuisines, perfected over generations in competitive hawker stalls, is unmatched anywhere."
  - question: "What about the strict laws?"
    answer: "Don't bring drugs (death penalty), don't chew gum (illegal), don't jaywalk (fines). In practice, normal tourist behavior is fine. The strictness creates a clean, safe city. Just don't litter or eat/drink on the MRT."

## Your Day in Singapore Awaits

Singapore is a cheat code for solo travel: all of Asia's complexity, none of Asia's friction.

The hawker centers feed you world-class food for pocket change. The MRT takes you anywhere with perfect efficiency. The cultural neighborhoods deliver diversity in 20-minute walks. And the safety — the absolute, remarkable safety — lets you wander at midnight without a second thought.

This is the city that works. And it works beautifully alone.
