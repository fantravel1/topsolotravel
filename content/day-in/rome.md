quickAnswer: "A solo day in Rome begins early — the Colosseum opens at 8:30am, and first entry means near-solitude in history's greatest amphitheater. Stand at the bar for espresso (€1, the Italian way), then walk to the Forum as the sun rises over ancient columns. Afternoons are for Trastevere's trattorias and gelato wandering. Evenings bring aperitivo (drinks with free snacks) and solo pasta dinners where the waiter becomes your friend. Budget €65-100."

reality:
  expect: "Overwhelming beauty, excellent food everywhere, late dining culture, passionate locals, some tourist hassle at big sites"
  surprise: "How walkable the center is, how cheap coffee and snacks are, how eating alone is completely normal, the joy of getting lost"
  challenge: "Colosseum/Vatican queues without booking, scams near tourist sites, August closures, the heat in summer"

morning:
  timeRange: "7:30 AM - 12:00 PM"
  insight: "Romans stand at the bar for morning espresso — sitting costs more and marks you as a tourist. The ancient sites are best before 10am, when tour groups arrive. Watching the sun hit the Colosseum early is worth every groggy moment."

      title: "Bar Espresso Ritual"
      description: "Find any bar (café, in Italian). Stand at the counter. Say 'un caffè.' The barista will pull a perfect espresso, you'll drink it in three sips, leave €1 on the counter, and go. This takes 3 minutes. You've just done as Romans do."
      tip: "Cornetto (croissant) for €1.50 makes it breakfast. Don't say 'cappuccino' after 11am."
      cost: "€2-3"

      title: "Colosseum First Entry"
      description: "With advance tickets, you can enter at 8:30am when doors open. The arena floor is nearly empty. Stand where gladiators stood. Let 50,000 ghosts fill the seats around you. This moment — alone in the Colosseum — is why you woke early."
      tip: "Book the combined Colosseum/Forum/Palatine ticket online. Arena floor access costs extra but is worth it."

      emoji: "🏛️"
      title: "Roman Forum Walk"
      description: "Your Colosseum ticket includes the Forum. Walk the Via Sacra, the road of triumph parades. Stand in the Senate where Caesar fell. Watch the columns glow as the sun rises. Having no guide means you can stop where curiosity strikes."
      tip: "Download a free audio guide app before — the Forum needs context."

      title: "Trevi Fountain Moment"
      description: "It will be crowded. Go anyway. Elbow through, find your spot, throw a coin over your shoulder with your right hand (tradition). Then retreat to Vicus Caprarius under the street — the archaeological site below shows the fountain's ancient water source. Usually empty."
      tip: "Come back at midnight when it's emptier and lit beautifully."

      description: "Cross the Tiber to Trastevere, the old neighborhood with narrow streets and ivy-covered buildings. Find a trattoria with paper tablecloths and a handwritten menu. Order cacio e pepe or amatriciana. The waiter will recommend wine. Solo diners are beloved here."

      title: "Gelato Quest"
      description: "Roman gelato ruins all other ice cream forever. Look for 'gelato artigianale' signs and covered metal bins (not piled-high fluorescent displays). Pistacchio and stracciatella are classics. Walk and eat. This is correct behavior."
      tip: "Giolitti near Pantheon is historic. Fatamorgana for creative flavors."

      title: "Aperitivo Hour"
      description: "Rome's aperitivo is magic for solo travelers. Order a Spritz or Negroni (€8-12), and free snacks appear — olives, cheese, bruschetta, sometimes full buffets. Sit at the bar, nurse your drink, graze. You've just had dinner's appetizer for the price of a cocktail."
      tip: "Rec 23 in Trastevere, Freni e Frizioni by the river."
      cost: "€10-15"

evening:

  soloDining:
    - "Trattorias with bar seating — tell them you're solo and they'll seat you well"
    - "Pizza al taglio shops — stand and eat by the slice"
    - "Wine bars with small plates — Roscioli, Cul de Sac"
    - "Eataly Rome — market and restaurants, tables for one easy"
    - "Any place with 'da' in the name (Da Felice, Da Enzo) — usually excellent"

      title: "Dinner for One"
      description: "Romans eat late (9pm is normal). Find your trattoria — maybe back in Trastevere, maybe near Campo de' Fiori. Tell the host 'per uno.' They'll give you a good table. Order the house red in a carafe, a pasta, a secondo if hungry. Linger. No one will rush you."
      tip: "Skip tourist menus with photos. Ask 'cosa mi consiglia?' — what do you recommend?"

      title: "Piazza Night Walk"
      description: "After dinner, Rome's piazzas come alive. Piazza Navona has artists and musicians. Campo de' Fiori has bars spilling into the street. The Pantheon at night, lit against the dark, stops you in your tracks. Just walk. Every turn reveals something."
      tip: "The Pantheon is free to enter until late. Stand under the oculus and look up."

      title: "Late Night Choices"
      description: "Rome's nightlife is more about lingering than clubbing. Wine bars stay open late, piazzas have conversation until 2am, and pizza al taglio shops serve slices to the walking crowd. Trastevere and Testaccio have actual clubs if you want them."
      tip: "Supplì (fried rice balls) from any late-night shop is the perfect end."

proTip: "Rome is best walked, but the Metro is useful for longer distances (Colosseum to Vatican, for example). Buy a day pass if making multiple trips. Buses are confusing; the Metro isn't."

moment:
  quote: "The waiter asked if I was waiting for someone. I said no, just me. He smiled, brought a carafe of house red 'on the house — for travelers,' and checked on me three times during dinner, each time with a small extra: olives, bread, a taste of tiramisu. I've never felt less alone."
  location: "Trattoria in Trastevere"
  time: "9:30 PM"

faqs:
  - question: "Is Rome good for solo travelers?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Romans respect solo diners — the culture of long meals works perfectly for individuals. The city is walkable, safe at night, and rewards aimless wandering. Every piazza, church, and corner offers something. You'll never be bored alone in Rome."
  - question: "How much does a day in Rome cost?"
    answer: "A comfortable day costs €65-100 ($70-110). Espresso and pastry (€3), Colosseum (€18), lunch (€18), gelato (€4), aperitivo (€12), dinner (€30), transit (€6). You can reduce costs with pizza al taglio lunches and aperitivo as dinner."
  - question: "Is it safe to walk alone at night?"
    answer: "Central Rome is very safe at night. The main tourist areas — Trastevere, Centro Storico, around the major sites — are populated late. Normal city awareness applies: watch for pickpockets on crowded buses, avoid completely empty streets, and ignore anyone too eager to help you at ATMs."
  - question: "Where should solo travelers stay?"
    answer: "Trastevere is charming and social, perfect for solo travelers. Centro Storico (around Piazza Navona) is convenient but pricier. Monti has boutique hotels and trendy bars. Testaccio is local and excellent for food. All are well-connected."

## Your Day in Rome Awaits

Rome has welcomed solo wanderers since before tourism existed. Pilgrims, artists, poets, emperors — they all walked these stones alone with their thoughts.

The city doesn't require company to deliver its magic. The espresso is the same at the bar alone. The Colosseum doesn't need a witness to awe you. The pasta arrives perfect whether the table seats one or ten.

All roads lead to Rome. Today, your road leads you.
