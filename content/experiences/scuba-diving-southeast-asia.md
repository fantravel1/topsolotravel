## The Transformation

There's something about being underwater that changes solo travelers. The silence, the weightlessness, the alien beauty of coral reefs - it puts land-based problems in perspective.

Many solo divers describe a kind of meditation underwater. Others talk about the confidence that comes from mastering something new. And almost everyone mentions the community - the instant friendships formed over shared passion.

When you surface from your final dive, waterlogged and happy, you'll understand why so many solo travelers get hooked. The underwater world is calling. All you have to do is descend.
