## Travel Health Insurance

### Why It's Non-Negotiable

Regular health insurance usually doesn't cover you abroad. Without travel insurance:
- A hospital stay could bankrupt you
- Medical evacuation costs $50,000-100,000+
- You may need to pay upfront for care
- No assistance finding English-speaking doctors

### What to Look For

**Essential coverage:**
- Medical expenses (minimum $100,000, ideally $500,000+)
- Emergency medical evacuation
- Repatriation of remains (morbid but important)
- 24/7 emergency assistance line

**Good additions:**
- Trip cancellation/interruption
- Lost/delayed baggage
- Coverage for adventure activities
- Mental health coverage
- Pre-existing conditions (if applicable)

### Recommended Providers

**Popular options:**
- World Nomads (backpackers, adventure activities)
- Safety Wing (digital nomads, long-term)
- IMG Global (comprehensive)
- Allianz Travel (mainstream)
- Seven Corners (expats)

**Compare on:** coverage limits, deductibles, exclusions, reviews of claims experience.

## Staying Healthy on the Road

### Food & Water Safety

**The basics:**
- "Boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it"
- Bottled water in developing countries
- Avoid ice unless certain of source
- Hot, freshly cooked food is safest
- Street food can be safe if popular and freshly made

**High-risk foods:**
- Raw or undercooked seafood
- Rare meat
- Unpasteurized dairy
- Salads washed in tap water
- Pre-cut fruit (washed in what?)

### Traveler's Diarrhea

**The most common travel illness:**
- Affects 30-70% of travelers to developing countries
- Usually self-limiting (3-5 days)
- Caused by bacteria in food/water

**Prevention:**
- Careful food and water choices
- Wash hands frequently
- Use hand sanitizer when water unavailable

**Treatment:**
- **Hydration is key**: Oral rehydration salts (ORS)
- **Loperamide (Imodium)**: Controls symptoms, doesn't cure
- **Antibiotics**: For severe cases (azithromycin, ciprofloxacin)
- See a doctor if: bloody stool, high fever, no improvement after 72 hours

**Pack:** ORS packets, Imodium, antibiotics (with prescription)

### Altitude Sickness

**Risk areas:** High-altitude destinations (Peru, Bolivia, Nepal, Tibet, Colorado)

**Symptoms:**
- Headache
- Nausea
- Fatigue
- Difficulty sleeping
- Shortness of breath

**Prevention:**
- Ascend gradually (500m per day above 3,000m)
- Stay hydrated
- Avoid alcohol initially
- Acetazolamide (Diamox) prophylaxis

**Treatment:**
- Descend if symptoms severe
- Rest at current altitude if mild
- Supplemental oxygen if available

### Sun Protection

**Don't underestimate:**
- Higher altitudes = stronger UV
- Tropical sun is intense
- Reflection from water/snow increases exposure
- Medication can increase sensitivity

**Prevention:**
- SPF 30+ sunscreen, reapplied every 2 hours
- Protective clothing
- Sunglasses (UV blocking)
- Seek shade 10am-4pm
- Stay extra cautious first few days

### Jet Lag

**Minimize impact:**
