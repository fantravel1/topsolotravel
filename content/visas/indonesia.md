## Indonesia Visa Overview for US Citizens

Indonesia offers several entry options for US passport holders. For most solo travelers heading to Bali, the **Visa on Arrival (VOA)** is the best choice as it can be extended.

## Entry Options Compared

| Option | Duration | Cost | Extendable |
|--------|----------|------|------------|
| Visa-Free | 30 days | Free | No |
| Visa on Arrival | 30 days | 500,000 IDR | Yes (+30 days) |
| B211A Visa | 60 days | ~$300+ | Yes (+120 days) |
| e-VOA | 30 days | 519,000 IDR | Yes (+30 days) |

## Recommended: Visa on Arrival

For flexibility, **always get the VOA** unless you're 100% certain about leaving within 30 days.

### At the Airport
1. **Don't go to the visa-free line** - you'll regret it if you want to extend
2. Look for **"Visa on Arrival"** counter before immigration
3. Pay **500,000 IDR** (~$32) - card or cash accepted
4. Receive VOA sticker in passport
5. Proceed to immigration for entry stamp

### e-VOA (Apply Before Travel)
You can now apply for VOA online to skip airport lines:
1. Visit [Indonesia e-VOA Portal](https://molina.imigrasi.go.id)
2. Apply 2-14 days before arrival
3. Pay 519,000 IDR online
4. Print approval letter
5. Go directly to immigration at airport

## Extending Your VOA

### DIY Extension
1. Visit immigration office 7+ days before expiry
2. Bring: passport, photos, copy of passport/visa
3. Pay extension fee (~500,000 IDR)
4. Return in 4-5 working days for stamp

### Immigration Offices
- **Bali**: Ngurah Rai (airport area) or Denpasar
- **Jakarta**: Multiple locations
- **Yogyakarta**: Jl. Solo

### Using an Agent
Most travelers use visa agents (~$40-60):
- They handle paperwork
- You just hand over passport
- Convenient but requires trust
- Ask accommodation for recommendations

## B211A Visa (Social/Cultural)

For stays beyond 60 days, the **B211A** is popular:

### Requirements
- Indonesian sponsor (person or company)
- Sponsor letter and ID
- Passport with 18+ months validity
- Passport photos
- Flight itinerary (not necessarily return)

### Benefits
- Initial 60 days
- Extendable 4 times (30 days each)
- Up to 180 days total
- Multiple entry available

### Getting a Sponsor
- Visa agencies can provide sponsors (~$250-400)
- Hotels/villas sometimes sponsor guests
- Indonesian friends can sponsor you

## Common Entry Points

### Bali
- **Ngurah Rai Airport (DPS)** - Main gateway to Bali
- Both VOA counter and e-VOA counters available

### Java
- **Soekarno-Hatta Airport (CGK)** - Jakarta
- **Juanda Airport (SUB)** - Surabaya

### Other Islands
- **Lombok Airport (LOP)**
- **Yogyakarta Airport (YIA)**

## Bali-Specific Tips

### Money
- ATMs charge 50,000-100,000 IDR fees
- BCA and Mandiri banks have better rates
- Wise card works well
- Some places accept USD but rate is poor

### Getting Around
- Download Gojek and Grab apps
- Rent scooter (~50,000 IDR/day)
- International license technically required

### Don't Overstay
- Fine is 1,000,000 IDR per day overstay
- Potential deportation and ban
- Immigration raids happen in tourist areas

## Digital Nomad Considerations

Indonesia launched a **Digital Nomad Visa** (Second Home Visa) but requirements are steep:
- Bank balance of $130,000+ or
- Passive income of $2,000/month for 5 years

Most digital nomads use the B211A visa instead, though technically it doesn't permit work. Many work quietly for foreign clients without issues.

## Best Time to Arrive

- Avoid arriving after midnight - longer waits
- Morning arrivals have shorter immigration lines
- Weekdays better than weekends in peak season
