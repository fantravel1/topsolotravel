## Mexico Visa Overview for US Citizens

Mexico offers incredibly generous terms for US passport holders: **up to 180 days without a visa**. This, combined with proximity to the US and low cost of living, makes Mexico a top destination for solo travelers and digital nomads.

## Entry Process

### By Air

1. **Complete Digital FMM** at [INM Website](https://www.inm.gob.mx/fmme/publico/en/solicitud.html) before travel (optional but recommended)
2. **Or receive paper FMM** on your flight
3. **At immigration**, present passport and FMM
4. **Officer stamps passport** and writes your authorized days
5. **Keep your FMM** - you need it to leave Mexico

### By Land

1. **Stop at immigration booth** at border crossing
2. **Complete FMM form** and present passport
3. **Pay fee** (~$35 USD) if staying over 7 days
4. **Receive stamped FMM** with authorized days
5. **Don't lose it** - needed for exit and potential checkpoints

## Understanding Your Days

### Not Always 180
While most Americans receive 180 days, immigration officers have discretion:
- Looking scruffy or answering vaguely may result in fewer days
- Frequent recent visits may trigger shorter stays
- Having clear travel plans helps

### What to Do if Given Fewer Days
- **Ask politely** - sometimes officers will add more
- **Don't argue** - accept what's given
- **Extend later** - visit INM office before expiry

## Major Entry Points

### Airports
- **Mexico City (MEX)** - Main international gateway
- **Cancun (CUN)** - Riviera Maya access
- **Guadalajara (GDL)** - Western Mexico
- **Los Cabos (SJD)** - Baja California
- **Puerto Vallarta (PVR)** - Pacific coast

### Land Borders
- **Tijuana/San Ysidro** - Most crossed border in world
- **Nogales** - Arizona crossing
- **Laredo** - Texas crossing
- **El Paso/Juarez** - Texas/Chihuahua

## Extending Your Stay

### At INM Office
1. Visit before your permit expires
2. Bring: passport, FMM, proof of funds, accommodation
3. Pay extension fee
4. Receive new FMM or stamp

### Extensions are Not Guaranteed
- Maximum total stay is 180 days
- Officer discretion applies
- Having solid reasons helps

## Popular Digital Nomad Spots

Mexico has become a digital nomad hub:

### Mexico City (CDMX)
- World-class food scene
- Great coworking spaces
- Rich culture
- Most affordable major city

### Playa del Carmen
- Beach town vibes
- Strong nomad community
- Good internet infrastructure

### Oaxaca
- Colonial charm
- Food capital of Mexico
- Artisan culture
- Growing nomad scene

### Puerto Vallarta
- Pacific beaches
- LGBTQ+ friendly
- Established expat community

## Legal Considerations

### Working Remotely
Technically, the FMM doesn't authorize work. However:
- Working for foreign clients (not Mexican employers) is common
- No enforcement for remote workers
- Mexican clients/income requires work visa

### Temporary Resident Visa
For stays beyond 180 days or working legally:
- Apply at Mexican consulate in US
- Requires income proof (~$2,500/month) or savings
- Grants 1-4 year residency
- Work permit can be added

## Taxes

### The 183-Day Rule
Stay over 183 days in a calendar year and you may become a Mexican tax resident. Digital nomads often:
- Leave before 183 days
- Consult with tax professionals
- Understand both US and Mexican obligations

## Common Mistakes

1. **Losing your FMM** - Getting a replacement is a hassle
2. **Assuming 180 days** - Check your actual stamp
3. **Ignoring extension timeline** - Start process early
4. **Not having return ticket** - Can cause issues at land borders
5. **Overstaying** - Fines and potential future entry bans

## Tips for Success

### At Immigration
- Be clean and presentable
- Have hotel booking ready to show
- Know your travel dates
- Be friendly and confident

### During Your Stay
- Keep passport and FMM safe
- Take photos of all documents
- Know location of nearest INM office
- Register with US Embassy STEP program
