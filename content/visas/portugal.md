## Portugal Visa Overview for US Citizens

US passport holders can visit Portugal **visa-free for up to 90 days** within any 180-day period. This is part of the Schengen Agreement that covers 27 European countries.

## Understanding Schengen

This is crucial for planning: **your 90 days covers ALL Schengen countries combined**, including:

Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Austria, Switzerland, and 18 others.

### The 90/180 Rule Explained
- Count back 180 days from any date
- You can only have spent 90 days in Schengen during that window
- Use a [Schengen calculator](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/content/visa-calculator_en) to track your days

## Entry Process

### First Schengen Entry
If Portugal is your first Schengen destination:
1. Present passport at immigration
2. May be asked about accommodation, funds, and travel plans
3. Receive Schengen entry stamp

### Entering from Another Schengen Country
If you already entered Schengen elsewhere (e.g., flew into Paris first):
- No immigration control between Schengen countries
- Your original entry stamp applies
- No Portugal-specific stamp

## ETIAS (Starting 2025)

From 2025, US citizens will need **ETIAS authorization** before traveling:
- **Cost**: €7
- **Validity**: 3 years or until passport expires
- **Process**: Online application, usually approved in minutes
- **Applies to**: All Schengen Area travel

## Lisbon Entry Points

- **Lisbon Airport (LIS)** - Main international gateway
- **Porto Airport (OPO)** - Northern Portugal access
- **Faro Airport (FAO)** - Algarve beaches
- **Land borders** - Open travel from Spain

## Staying Longer: Digital Nomad Visa

Portugal's **D8 Digital Nomad Visa** is perfect for remote workers:

### Requirements
- Monthly income of €3,040+ (4x minimum wage)
- Income from non-Portuguese sources
- Proof of remote work arrangement
- Health insurance
- Clean criminal record

### Benefits
- 1-year initial stay (renewable)
- Path to residency
- Access to Portuguese healthcare
- Can travel freely in Schengen

### Application Process
1. Apply at Portuguese consulate in US
2. Submit income proof, contracts, insurance
3. Wait 60-90 days for processing
4. Pick up visa and travel to Portugal

## Solo Traveler Tips

### Banking
- Wise or Revolut cards work great
- Many ATMs charge fees - look for Multibanco
- Credit cards widely accepted in cities

### Accommodation
- Booking.com proof usually satisfies immigration
- For longer stays, expect landlords to ask for NIF (tax number)
- You can get NIF at tax office with passport

### Connectivity
- EU roaming means your European SIM works
- Local SIM options: MEO, NOS, Vodafone
- Strong WiFi culture in cafés

## Common Questions

### Can I work remotely in Portugal on the 90-day visa-free stay?
Technically no, but enforcement for remote workers with foreign clients is minimal. For peace of mind and stays over 90 days, get the Digital Nomad Visa.

### What happens if I overstay?
Overstaying Schengen can result in fines, bans, and future visa difficulties across all Schengen countries. Take the 90/180 rule seriously.

### Can I leave Schengen and reset my 90 days?
You must spend 90 days outside Schengen before a new 90-day period begins. A weekend in Morocco doesn't reset your clock.
