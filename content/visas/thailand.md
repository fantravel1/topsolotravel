## Thailand Visa Overview for US Citizens

Great news for American solo travelers! **US passport holders can enter Thailand visa-free for up to 30 days**. This makes Thailand one of the most accessible destinations in Southeast Asia for spontaneous trips.

## Entry Process

Arriving in Thailand is straightforward:

1. **On your flight**, you'll receive an arrival/departure card
2. **Fill out both sides** with your flight info, passport details, and Thai address
3. **At immigration**, present your passport and the arrival card
4. **Keep the departure card** stapled in your passport - you'll need it when leaving

## Best Entry Points

- **Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK)** - Bangkok's main international airport
- **Don Mueang Airport (DMK)** - Bangkok's budget airline hub
- **Phuket International Airport (HKT)** - Gateway to southern beaches
- **Chiang Mai Airport (CNX)** - Direct access to northern Thailand

## Extending Your Stay

If 30 days isn't enough (it often isn't!), you have options:

### 30-Day Extension
Visit any Immigration Office with:
- Your passport
- One passport photo
- Completed TM.7 form
- 1,900 THB fee
- Address in Thailand

Popular immigration offices:

## Solo Traveler Tips

- **Register with STEP** (Smart Traveler Enrollment Program)
- **Have immigration office addresses** saved in your phone
- **Don't overstay** - fines are 500 THB/day with potential bans

## Common Questions

### Can I work on a tourist visa?
No. Working (including remote work that serves Thai clients) requires a work permit. Digital nomads working for foreign companies generally don't face issues, but technically a visa doesn't permit work.

### What about the Thailand Elite Visa?
This is a premium long-stay visa (5-20 years) starting at 600,000 THB. It's popular with digital nomads and retirees wanting hassle-free long-term stays.
