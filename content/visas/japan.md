## Japan Visa Overview for US Citizens

Japan offers one of the most generous visa-free arrangements for US passport holders: **90 days without a visa**. This makes Japan perfect for extended solo travel adventures.

## Before You Fly

### Visit Japan Web
Complete your entry procedures online before departure:
1. Create an account at [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/)
2. Register your trip details
3. Complete immigration and customs forms digitally
4. Receive a QR code to scan at arrival

This significantly speeds up arrival processing and is highly recommended.

## Entry Process

Arriving in Japan is efficient and organized:

1. **Immigration** - Present passport, show Visit Japan Web QR code or paper arrival card
2. **Biometrics** - Fingerprints and photo taken (standard for all foreigners)
3. **Customs** - Present declaration (QR code or paper form)
4. **Baggage claim** - Collect your belongings

## Major Entry Points

- **Narita Airport (NRT)** - Tokyo's main international airport
- **Haneda Airport (HND)** - Closer to central Tokyo
- **Kansai Airport (KIX)** - Osaka/Kyoto gateway
- **Fukuoka Airport (FUK)** - Kyushu entry point
- **New Chitose Airport (CTS)** - Hokkaido gateway

## Understanding Your Status

Your passport will be stamped with:
- **"短期滞在" (Tanki Taizai)** - Temporary Visitor
- **90 days** - Maximum stay period
- **No work permitted**

## Solo Traveler Considerations

### Accommodation Registration
If staying at hotels, they handle registration. For Airbnb or private rentals longer than a few weeks, you may need to register at the local ward office (区役所).

### Japan Rail Pass
Purchase BEFORE arriving in Japan. The JR Pass offers unlimited travel on JR trains and is essential for solo travelers exploring multiple regions.

### Cash Culture
Japan is still heavily cash-based. Carry yen, though major cities increasingly accept cards. 7-Eleven ATMs reliably accept foreign cards.

## Long-Term Options

If 90 days isn't enough:

- **Leave and re-enter** - Visit Korea, Taiwan, or another country, then return for new 90 days
- **Working Holiday Visa** - For ages 18-30, allows 1 year stay with work rights
- **Student Visa** - For language schools or universities
- **Work Visa** - Requires employer sponsorship

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't overstay** - Japan takes immigration seriously; overstays result in bans
2. **Don't work** - Even remote work for Japanese clients is technically prohibited
3. **Don't assume you can extend** - Tourist stays cannot be extended
4. **Don't leave without your departure stamp** - Keep track of your status
