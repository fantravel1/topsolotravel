## Understanding Visa Types

### Visa-Free Entry
No advance application needed. Present your passport at immigration and receive entry permission on arrival. Most common for US passport holders.

### Visa on Arrival (VOA)
No advance application, but you'll pay a fee at the airport. Popular in Southeast Asia. Sometimes offers benefits like extensions that visa-free doesn't.

### E-Visa
Apply online before travel. Usually approved within a few days. Often allows longer stays than visa-free options.

### Embassy Visa
Traditional visa requiring an appointment at a consulate before travel. Less common for tourist travel but needed for some destinations.
