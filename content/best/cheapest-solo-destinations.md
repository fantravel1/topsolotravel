faqs:
  - question: "Can you really travel on $30 a day?"
    answer: "Yes, in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central America, $30/day is comfortable. This includes a private room at a budget guesthouse ($10-15), three meals at local restaurants ($6-10), local transport ($2-5), and one activity or entrance fee ($5-10). It requires eating where locals eat and choosing budget accommodation, but you won't suffer."
  - question: "What's included in these daily budgets?"
    answer: "Our daily budgets include: accommodation, all meals, local transport, and average activity costs spread across a trip. They don't include international flights, travel insurance, visas, or splurge purchases. Budget travelers can go 20% lower; comfort travelers might spend 30% more."
  - question: "Is budget travel uncomfortable?"
    answer: "Budget travel is different, not uncomfortable. A $10 room in Vietnam might be nicer than a $100 room in New York. A $2 street food meal might be better than a $20 restaurant dinner. The adjustment is mindset, not suffering. Most budget travelers report being more comfortable once they stop chasing 'Western standards.'"
  - question: "How do I save money while traveling solo?"
    answer: "Eat where locals eat (not tourist restaurants). Walk when possible. Book accommodation a day ahead, not months. Travel slowly — transport costs add up. Learn to cook occasionally. Use apps like Grab for fair taxi prices. And remember: the cheapest experiences are often the best."

## The Real Cost of Budget Travel

Budget travel isn't about deprivation — it's about **choices**.

You choose street food over restaurants. You choose local buses over taxis. You choose guesthouses over hotels. And in exchange, you get months instead of weeks. Experiences instead of stuff. Stories instead of souvenirs.

These twelve destinations reward that choice. The best meals are often the cheapest. The most authentic experiences are free. And the people you meet while traveling on $30/day are more interesting than those you'd meet at resorts.

## How to Use This List

Pick a region. Southeast Asia, Central America, South Asia — each has enough $30-50/day destinations to fill months.

Build a route through multiple countries. Vietnam → Cambodia → Thailand. Guatemala → Mexico → Belize. Nepal → India → Sri Lanka.

Budget $30/day for the foundation, $50/day for comfort and activities. You'll average out to something sustainable.

Then go. For as long as you can. These destinations will stretch your money — and your perspective.
