## Bhutan

### Why It Works for Solo Luxury

Bhutan's "high value, low impact" tourism policy means a required daily tariff that includes guide, car, accommodation, and meals. Solo travelers pay the same as couples (no supplement), and the experience is inherently personalized.

**Luxury upgrades**:
- Six Senses: Multiple lodges across the country

- Guide becomes your personal curator
- No awkward group dynamics
- Pace entirely to your interest
- Deep conversations about Gross National Happiness
- Spiritual dimension for solo reflection

**Tiger's Nest hike**: The iconic monastery hike is profound solo.

**Budget**: $200-1,000/day depending on luxury level

## The Solo Luxury Philosophy

Luxury travel isn't about couples. It's about excellence, attention, and experience - all of which are enhanced, not diminished, when traveling alone.

When you check into a suite overlooking the Amalfi Coast, there's no one to ask "what do you want to do?" The answer is whatever you want. When the sommelier approaches, you choose the wine. When the spa offers a treatment time, it fits your schedule.

Solo luxury travel is the purest form of self-investment. You're worth it.

**Check in, solo luxury traveler.** The suite is ready.
