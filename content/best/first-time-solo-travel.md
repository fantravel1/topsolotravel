faqs:
  - question: "What if I get lonely on my first solo trip?"
    answer: "Loneliness is normal and usually temporary. Stay in hostels for built-in social opportunities. Join walking tours or cooking classes. Eat at bar counters where conversation happens naturally. Most first-time solo travelers report feeling lonely for day one, then wonder why they ever worried."
  - question: "How do I stay safe as a first-time solo traveler?"
    answer: "Choose destinations with strong safety records (all on this list qualify). Share your itinerary with someone at home. Trust your instincts — if something feels wrong, leave. Stay aware in crowded areas. Get travel insurance. The reality is that millions travel solo safely every year."
  - question: "How much should I budget for my first solo trip?"
    answer: "That depends on the destination. Japan and Western Europe run $70-100/day; Thailand and Portugal are $30-60/day. Budget 20% more than you expect for first trips — you'll make inefficient decisions while learning. Better to come home with extra money than anxiety."
  - question: "Should I plan everything or leave room for spontaneity?"
    answer: "For first trips, plan your first few nights and have a loose itinerary. Don't lock in every detail — the best moments come from flexibility. Book accommodation 1-2 days ahead maximum once you've found your rhythm. The confidence to improvise builds quickly."

## The First Trip Changes Everything

Your first solo trip will probably be shorter than you want, more carefully planned than you need, and more transformative than you expect.

Every experienced solo traveler remembers their first destination. It's where they learned that eating alone isn't sad, that strangers can become friends, that their own company is enough.

These ten destinations won't just give you a vacation — they'll give you confidence. And that confidence opens up the entire world.

## Start Small, Dream Big

Pick one destination from this list. Book a flight. Reserve a hostel for the first two nights.

The rest will figure itself out. It always does.
