## Avoiding Single Supplements

The solo traveler's nemesis: paying extra because you're traveling alone. Here's how to minimize or avoid them.

### Strategies That Work

**1. Choose solo-friendly booking sites**
- Intrepid Travel (no single supplements on many tours)
- G Adventures (affordable single supplements)
- Flash Pack (designed for solo travelers 30-49)

**2. Look for single rooms**
Some hotels have smaller rooms priced for one person, not a double at 75% price.

**3. Book boutique over chains**
Independent hotels are more likely to negotiate or have fair single rates.

**4. Travel off-peak**
When hotels struggle to fill rooms, they're more flexible on pricing.

**5. Contact hotels directly**
Email and ask about single rates - you might get a better deal than online.

**6. Consider aparthotels**
Studio apartments are priced per unit, not per person.

**7. Book last-minute**
Apps like HotelTonight often have single-friendly pricing.

### Countries Where Single Supplements Are Lower

- **Southeast Asia** - Many places don't charge them at all
- **Portugal** - Generally fair single pricing
- **Japan** - Business hotels designed for solo travelers
- **Eastern Europe** - More affordable options
- **South America** - Backpacker infrastructure helps
